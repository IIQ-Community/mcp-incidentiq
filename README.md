cd mcp-incidentiq
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```

3. Configure your environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your district's IncidentIQ credentials:
```env
# Your district's IncidentIQ URL (e.g., https://mydistrict.incidentiq.com/api/v1.0)
IIQ_API_BASE_URL=https://your-district.incidentiq.com/api/v1.0

# API key from IncidentIQ Administration > Developer Tools
IIQ_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Optional: Request timeout in milliseconds (default: 30000)
IIQ_API_TIMEOUT=30000
```

## Configuration

### Obtaining API Credentials

1. Log into your district's IncidentIQ instance as an administrator
2. Navigate to **Administration** > **Developer tools**
3. Generate or copy your API key (JWT token)
4. Note your district's base URL (format: `https://[district].incidentiq.com`)

### Claude Desktop Integration

To use this MCP server with Claude Desktop, see our comprehensive [Claude Desktop Setup Guide](docs/CLAUDE_DESKTOP_SETUP.md).

Quick configuration example:

1. Open Claude Desktop settings
2. Navigate to Developer > MCP Settings
3. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "incidentiq": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp-incidentiq/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "IIQ_API_BASE_URL": "https://your-district.incidentiq.com/api/v1.0",
        "IIQ_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/mcp-incidentiq` with the actual path to this project.

## Usage

### Development Mode

```bash
yarn dev
```

This starts the server with hot-reload enabled for development.

### Production Mode

```bash
yarn build
yarn start
```

### Testing Connection

Once connected to Claude, you can test your connection:

```
Claude: "Test the IncidentIQ connection"
```
