# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This project creates a functional MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for IncidentIQ, the #1 K-12 service management platform used by 2000+ school districts. The server enables AI assistants to interact with district IncidentIQ instances, streamlining IT operations, asset management, and support workflows for educational institutions.

## Current State

The project has a fully functional MCP server implementation with comprehensive testing framework in place. Key features completed:

### Core Implementation
- **20+ MCP Tools**: Fully implemented tools across tickets, assets, users, and locations domains
- **Strongly Typed**: Complete TypeScript interfaces for all IncidentIQ API entities
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Authentication**: JWT Bearer token authentication with secure API key management
- **Pagination & Filtering**: Full support for search operations with filtering and pagination

### Testing Framework (Jest + MSW)
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive unit tests for API client and tool handlers
- **E2E Tests**: MCP test client for end-to-end testing
- **Mock Service Worker**: Realistic API mocking with K-12 specific test data
- **Test Coverage**: 87% test pass rate (47/54 tests passing)
- **K-12 Test Data**: Authentic educational scenarios with Chromebooks, student accounts, and classroom support

### API Documentation
The `context/iiq-api/` directory contains 13 Swagger/OpenAPI 2.0 specification files documenting the complete IncidentIQ API surface, covering all six core modules:
- IT Help Desk & Ticketing
- IT Asset Management (Chromebooks, iPads, 1:1 devices)
- Facilities Management
- HR Service Delivery
- Event & Resource Management
- Analytics & Reporting

## Important: Context Directory

The `context/` directory is intentionally excluded from version control (in `.gitignore`). It contains:
- Third-party API documentation from IncidentIQ (not to be committed)
- Reference materials for development (local-only)
- AI session notes and context (machine-specific)

This directory serves as a local reference repository and should NOT be committed to GitHub.

## Development Setup

The project has been initialized with all necessary dependencies and structure.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Copy environment configuration
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your IncidentIQ API credentials

# Run development server
yarn dev
```

### Available Scripts

- `yarn dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `yarn build` - Build TypeScript to JavaScript
- `yarn start` - Run production server
- `yarn type-check` - Type check without building
- `yarn clean` - Clean build directory
- `yarn test` - Run all tests
- `yarn test:unit` - Run unit tests only
- `yarn test:e2e` - Run end-to-end tests only
- `yarn test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `yarn test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage report

## Architecture Guidelines

### MCP Server Structure

- Follow the standard MCP TypeScript SDK patterns
- Implement tools that map to IncidentIQ API endpoints
- Use the Swagger specs in `context/iiq-api/` as the source of truth for API contracts

### Available API Endpoints

The `context/iiq-api/` directory contains OpenAPI specifications for:

- **Core Entities**: Users (Students/Staff/Parents), Assets (Devices), Tickets, Locations (Buildings/Rooms)
- **Workflows**: Forms, SLAs, Views
- **Operations**: Analytics, Parts (Device Repair), Manufacturers
- **Communications**: Emails & Notifications (Parent communications)
- **Extensibility**: Custom Fields (District-specific data)

### Tool Design Principles

When implementing MCP tools:

1. Group related API operations into logical tools
2. Use clear, descriptive tool names that reflect IncidentIQ domain concepts
3. Implement proper error handling for API responses
4. Consider rate limiting and pagination for bulk operations

## MCP Implementation Reference

- **TypeScript SDK**: [github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk)
- **Example Servers**: [github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)
- **Best Practices**: Follow patterns from established MCP servers like filesystem, github, or slack servers

## API Integration Notes

- **Base URL**: District-specific (e.g., `https://[district].incidentiq.com/api/v1.0`)
- **API Version**: v1.0
- **Documentation Format**: Swagger 2.0 (generated by NSwag v13.3.0.0)
- **Authentication**: API key-based (obtained from district IncidentIQ administrator)
- **Compliance**: Consider FERPA/COPPA requirements when handling student data
- **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of API limits to avoid disrupting district operations
