# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This project creates a functional MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for IncidentIQ, the #1 K-12 service management platform used by 2000+ school districts. The server enables AI assistants to interact with district IncidentIQ instances, streamlining IT operations, asset management, and support workflows for educational institutions.

## Current State

**🚀 Initial Release Published**: The project has been successfully pushed to GitHub (IIQ-Community/mcp-incidentiq) with a fully functional MCP server implementation and comprehensive testing framework. Key features completed:

### Core Implementation
- **140+ MCP Tools**: Comprehensive tools across 9 distinct domain modules
- **9 Domain Modules**: Tickets, Users, Assets, Locations, Teams, Parts, Purchase Orders, Issues, Custom Fields
- **Strongly Typed**: Complete TypeScript interfaces for all IncidentIQ API entities
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Authentication**: JWT Bearer token authentication with secure API key management
- **Pagination & Filtering**: Full support for search operations with filtering and pagination
- **Comprehensive API Analysis**: All modules analyzed with 153+ validated endpoints

### Testing Framework (Jest + MSW)
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive unit tests for API client and tool handlers
- **E2E Tests**: MCP test client for end-to-end testing (currently disabled due to ES module issues)
- **Mock Service Worker**: Realistic API mocking with K-12 specific test data
- **Test Coverage**: 82% test pass rate (67/82 tests passing)
- **K-12 Test Data**: Authentic educational scenarios with Chromebooks, student accounts, and classroom support
- **Node Modules**: Switched from Yarn PnP to node_modules for better compatibility

### 🚨 Critical API Discovery (2025-01-08)
- **GUID Requirement**: All IncidentIQ IDs are GUIDs (e.g., `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`)
- **Test Ticket GUID**: Use `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` for testing ticket endpoints
- **Individual Resource Access**: 100% success rate when using proper GUIDs (was failing with placeholder IDs)
- **API Coverage**: ~90% of documented endpoints are functional (previously thought to be 47%)
- **Response Format**: GET endpoints return paginated objects `{Items: [], ItemCount: n, Paging: {...}}`
- **51+ Working Endpoints**: Comprehensive validation revealed extensive API functionality
- **Rate Limiting**: ⚠️ API requires 10 second delays between requests to avoid rate limiting

### CI/CD Status (2025-01-09)
- **✅ Type Checking**: Passing
- **✅ Build Process**: Passing
- **✅ Unit Tests**: 104/119 tests passing (15 E2E tests skipped, 0 failures)
- **⚠️ Code Coverage**: 22.57% statements (many new tool files not tested yet)
- **Coverage Thresholds**: Set to 77% statements/lines, 70% functions, 60% branches
- **Latest Updates**: 
  - Fixed all unit test failures (tool name mismatches resolved)
  - Added missing mock server endpoints
  - All active tests now passing with 100% success rate

### API Documentation
The `context/iiq-api/` directory contains 13 Swagger/OpenAPI 2.0 specification files documenting the complete IncidentIQ API surface, covering all six core modules:
- IT Help Desk & Ticketing
- IT Asset Management (Chromebooks, iPads, 1:1 devices)
- Facilities Management
- HR Service Delivery
- Event & Resource Management
- Analytics & Reporting

## Important: Context Directory

The `context/` directory is intentionally excluded from version control (in `.gitignore`). It contains:
- Third-party API documentation from IncidentIQ (not to be committed)
- Reference materials for development (local-only)
- AI session notes and context (machine-specific)

This directory serves as a local reference repository and should NOT be committed to GitHub.

## Project Organization Guidelines

### Directory Structure Best Practices

**IMPORTANT**: Maintain clean separation between production code and development/test artifacts.

#### Production Code (Commit to GitHub)
```

```

### File Organization Rules

1. **Production Code** → `/src/`
   - Only working, tested code
   - No test scripts or experiments
   
2. **Unit Tests** → `/tests/`
   - Jest tests that can run in CI/CD
   - No scripts that hit production APIs
   
3. **Test Scripts** → `/context/scripts/`
   - API validation scripts
   - Endpoint testing utilities
   - Scripts with hardcoded delays/GUIDs
   
4. **Documentation** → `/docs/` (public) or `/context/` (private)
   - Public docs in `/docs/`
   - Internal notes in `/context/`
   
5. **Sensitive Data** → `/context/config/`
   - API keys, tokens
   - Environment variables
   - Never in main repository

### When Creating New Files

Ask yourself:
- Is this production code? → `/src/`
- Is this a unit test? → `/tests/`
- Is this a test/validation script? → `/context/scripts/`
- Does it contain secrets? → `/context/config/`
- Is it documentation? → `/docs/` (public) or `/context/` (private)
- Is it a backup/old version? → `/context/tools-backup/`
- Is it a coverage report? → `/context/testing/coverage/`
- Is it API analysis? → `/context/api-analysis/`
- Is it district-specific? → `/context/` (e.g., district-specific configs)

### NEVER Commit to GitHub
- ❌ Coverage reports (move to `/context/testing/coverage/`)
- ❌ District-specific configurations (e.g., `.env.example.district`)
- ❌ API analysis documents (internal reference only)
- ❌ Test/validation scripts that hit production APIs
- ❌ Any file with hardcoded GUIDs, tokens, or credentials
- ❌ Third-party documentation (copyright concerns)
- ❌ Debug files, test outputs, or temporary files

## Development Setup

- `yarn test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `yarn test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage report

## Architecture Guidelines

### MCP Server Structure

- Follow the standard MCP TypeScript SDK patterns
- Implement tools that map to IncidentIQ API endpoints
- Use the Swagger specs in `context/iiq-api/` as the source of truth for API contracts

### Available API Endpoints

The `context/iiq-api/` directory contains OpenAPI specifications for:

- **Core Entities**: Users (Students/Staff/Parents), Assets (Devices), Tickets, Locations (Buildings/Rooms)
- **Workflows**: Forms, SLAs, Views
- **Operations**: Analytics, Parts (Device Repair), Manufacturers
- **Communications**: Emails & Notifications (Parent communications)
- **Extensibility**: Custom Fields (District-specific data)

### Tool Design Principles

When implementing MCP tools:

1. Group related API operations into logical tools
2. Use clear, descriptive tool names that reflect IncidentIQ domain concepts
3. Implement proper error handling for API responses
4. Consider rate limiting and pagination for bulk operations

## MCP Implementation Reference

- **TypeScript SDK**: [github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk)
- **Example Servers**: [github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)
- **Best Practices**: Follow patterns from established MCP servers like filesystem, github, or slack servers

## Modular Validation System (2025-01-08)

The project includes a comprehensive modular validation system for testing IncidentIQ API endpoints:

### Architecture
- **validation-base.ts**: Shared functionality for all validators with PowerShell headers
- **Module validators**: Individual scripts for each API module
- **validate-all.ts**: Master orchestration script
- **PowerShell alignment**: All validators now use production-tested patterns from a PowerShell module

### PowerShell Module Integration
The validators have been aligned with production PowerShell module patterns:
- **Query Parameters**: GET endpoints use `$p`, `$s`, `$d` for pagination
- **Required Headers**: `Client: WebBrowser`, specific User-Agent, `Pragma: no-cache`
- **POST Payloads**: Include `OnlyShowDeleted` and `FilterByViewPermission` fields
- **100% Success Rate**: PowerShell patterns work perfectly with 1-second delays

### Usage
```bash
# Run all modules (including PowerShell)
npx tsx context/scripts/modular/validate-all.ts

# Run specific modules
npx tsx context/scripts/modular/validate-all.ts tickets users teams parts

# Run with custom delay (1 second recommended)
API_DELAY_MS=1000 npx tsx context/scripts/modular/validate-all.ts

# Run individual module
npx tsx context/scripts/validate-tickets-endpoints.ts
```

### GUID Discovery
```bash
# Automatically discover and populate GUIDs
npx tsx context/scripts/discover-guids.ts

# Creates context/config/test-guids.env with discovered GUIDs
# All GUIDs are optional - only configure what you need
```

### Available Validators
- **Tickets**: 24 endpoints (wizards, search, configuration)
- **Users**: 18 endpoints (students, staff, parents, agents)
- **Assets**: 25 endpoints (Chromebooks, iPads, devices)
- **Locations**: 27 endpoints (schools, rooms, hierarchy)
- **Teams**: 9 endpoints (support teams, members, assignments)
- **Parts**: 17 endpoints (inventory, suppliers, stock tracking)
- **Purchase Orders**: 17 endpoints (POs, approvals, line items)
- **Issues**: 18 endpoints (issue types, categories, workflows)
- **Custom Fields**: 23 endpoints (field definitions for all entities)

### Configuration
- Uses `test-guids.env` for optional GUID configuration
- **Rate Limiting**: 1-second delays recommended (10-second delays cause timeouts)
- Generates reports in `context/validation-results/`
- PowerShell patterns documented in `context/POWERSHELL_ALIGNMENT.md`

## API Integration Notes

- **Base URL**: District-specific (e.g., `https://[district].incidentiq.com/api/v1.0`)
- **API Version**: v1.0
- **Documentation Format**: Swagger 2.0 (generated by NSwag v13.3.0.0)
- **Authentication**: API key-based (obtained from district IncidentIQ administrator)
- **Compliance**: Consider FERPA/COPPA requirements when handling student data
- **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of API limits to avoid disrupting district operations
